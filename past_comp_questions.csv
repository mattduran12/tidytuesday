"Several reports suggest that individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or who hold other marginalized sexual orientation and/or gender identities (LGBTQ+) are overrepresented within the criminal legal system. A major focus of this conversation is that criminological inquiry pays too little attention to sexual orientation and/or gender identities. In particular, some scholars have claimed that no criminological theories can explain the empirical relationship between the LGBTQ+ community and their over-representation within the criminal legal system. For this question, select one (and only one) of the following: a.	Identify a criminological theory that can explain the relationship. How does the theory explain the empirical relationship? Be sure to draw explicit attention to the causal mechanism of the theory that can explain the empirical relationship. 

OR

b.	Explain why no criminological theory can explain the relationship. This response should focus specifically on how sexual orientation and/or gender identity is outside the scope of existing criminological inquiry.","The traditional view is that the criminal justice system responds to crimes after they have occurred. Do you believe the criminal justice system can reduce crimes proactively before they occur? If so, please present a specific example relating to one part of the criminal justice system (i.e., policing, courts/sentencing, corrections, juvenile justice) and discuss the mechanism through which that criminal justice system proactively reduces crime. If not, please identify a scenario where one part of the criminal justice system attempts or appears to proactively affect crime, and discuss why it does not accomplish preventing crimes before they occur. In your answer, be sure to start with a brief description of your example, then move on discussing why it does/does not work to prevent crimes before they occur."
"Many places in the world have experienced extreme weather in recent years. For example, Phoenix had a 31-day streak of highs at or above 110 degrees this summer. As a criminologist, you are asked to speculate how extreme weather, such as extreme heat, may affect crime. Please pick two criminological theories and discuss how they can explain how extreme weather may affect crime. ","Recent statistics show that the racial and ethnic breakdown of the U.S. prison population is disproportionately Black and Hispanic. Choose one component of the criminal justice system (police, courts/sentencing, or corrections) that you believe most contributes to this disparity. Please briefly explain two practices or policies within your chosen component and then provide empirical support for how they contribute to disparities."
"On January 6th, 2021, Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol and interrupted Congress which was in the process of certifying President-elect Joe Biden’s win. Pick two criminological theories and using those theories, explain why some ""law-biding"" citizens were involved in the capitol riot.","Many criminal justice policies and practices have mixed empirical support. In your response, (1) identify and describe one of these policies or practices. Then, (2) describe the conditions or circumstances under which it has been found to be effective, and (3) the conditions or circumstances under which it has been found to be ineffective."
"Criminological theories evolve as society changes. Choose one theory and discuss how changes to society reshaped the theory. In your answer, do the following: 1) briefly describe the parts and assumptions of the theory prior to changing, 2) describe the societal shift that brought about the changes to the theory, and finally, 3) describe how the parts and assumptions of the theory changed after the societal shift. When writing, plan on spending more time on parts 2 and 3.","Criminal justice programs, practices, and policies are designed with the intention of ensuring fair and equal justice in preventing, responding to, and/or correcting criminal behavior. However, sometimes they have consequences that do not align with their intended outcomes. Identify a program, practice, or policy within policing, courts, or corrections that has had a particularly impactful unintended consequence. Please briefly identify the intended consequence(s) of that program, practice, or policy. Then, based on empirical evidence, make the case that the program, practice, or policy had unintended consequences that either positively or negatively impacted criminal justice related outcomes."
"Many theories have been put forth to explain crime, but the popularity of theories may vary over time. In some instances, a theory’s popularity, or lack thereof, may be a product of the social or political context of the time. Identify a theory whose popularity has either increased or decreased. Describe the basic tenets of the theory, and how the broader social, political and/or economic context affected its rise or fall in popularity.","Many criminal justice policies aim to constrain the discretion of key criminal justice actors (e.g., police, prosecutors, judges). One of the motivations driving these efforts to limit discretion is disparity reduction. Policymakers, apparently, believe that racial/ethnic/gender disparities can be reduced, if not eliminated, by limiting the discretionary powers of key criminal justice actors. With the preceding in mind, choose one key criminal justice system actor and then discuss: (1) specific efforts to control that actor’s discretion; (2) evaluate whether these efforts have actually reduced that actor’s discretionary powers; and (3) assess whether these efforts to constrain discretion have reduced racial/ethnic/gender disparities."
"In your opinion, what is the most contentious theory in criminology, and why? First, briefly summarize the basic tenets of your chosen contentious theory. Second, explain why the theory is contentious, making sure to acknowledge any critiques. Third, how would you modify or integrate the theory with another theory (or theories) to address these criticisms?","15 years ago, the journal Criminology & Public Policy created a special issue devoted to policy (2007, Volume 6:4). Editors Todd Clear and Natasha Frost described their efforts in this way: 
 
“The purpose of the essay was to propose that sufficient evidence now exists to support a particular policy in crime and justice. The policy proposition would become the title of the essay, and the body of the essay would contain a pointed summary of the evidence that supported that position. We emphasized that this was not intended as a “big idea” special issue, and its purpose was not to offer innovative or new policies that should be implemented and evaluated; instead, it was to be a complete issue devoted to noted scholars taking the position that we now have enough knowledge about some aspect of crime and justice that a policy is advised.”
 
Please provide your entry for a 2022 edition of this special issue. Please provide a title that is the policy proposition and then present the empirical evidence in support for the position you have taken. Although you may select a similar topic or build upon one from the 2007 edition, please take care to make a unique contribution. "
"Desistance from crime has received increasing theoretical and empirical attention over the past thirty years. Write an essay arguing either a) that one of the traditional theories of crime is adequate to explain desistance, or b) that one new theory developed during this time is essential to explain desistance.","Select one juvenile or criminal justice policy or practice. Describe the underlying logic of this policy/practice and the outcomes it is intended to achieve. Then, use existing scholarship to argue whether the current evidence supports the use of this policy (i.e., is the policy “evidence-based”?)."
"Since the late 1990s, the use of opioids has increased dramatically—becoming one of America’s most pressing public health crises. From 1999 to 2019 nearly 500,000 people died from an opioid overdose. Over 70,000 Americans died from a drug overdose in 2019 and 70% of these deaths involved opioid use. Unlike drug crises in the past, the opioid crisis disproportionately affects people who are older, white, and living in rural areas. First, select at least one criminological theory to explain the opioid crisis, paying particular attention to the population characteristics of those most affected. Second, discuss how the theoretical perspective(s) you select to explain the opioid crisis are similar or different from those that may explain the crack/cocaine epidemic of the late 1980s.","As a criminologist, in a world unbound by resource and time constraints, what is one major change in policy or practice you would propose to improve the efficiency, fairness, or effectiveness of how the criminal justice system functions? Please provide evidence to support why the major change and corresponding policy recommendation you propose is needed. "
"Choose one theory to explain how race is related to crime at the individual level, and then choose another theory to explain how race is related to crime at the contextual level (i.e., neighborhoods, cities, and/or other spatial areas like counties). Lastly, hypothesize on ways these two theories can be linked to provide a more compelling explanation for the link between race and crime.","Discretion is a defining feature of the American criminal justice system. Describe the role and impact of discretion at each phase of the criminal justice system, starting at police contact and working your way through to include re-entry and parole. In your discussion, highlight decision points at each stage of the justice system where discretion has been misused, identify the persons or communities most likely to experience that misuse of discretion, and describe the individual and social consequences of that misuse. "
"Select two theories of individual-level crime causation—one theory that you believe consists of well-defined concepts and a second theory that you believe does not. Please provide a summary of each theory, and then compare the theories emphasizing what you believe are the relative consequences of poor conceptual development while using supporting empirical evidence.","You are the newly elected governor of the great state of Bigotten. Congratulations on your election! However, Bigotten has been suffering from racial strife and protests about racial and ethnic bias in Bigotten’s criminal justice system for weeks in several of the largest urban cities in the state. As a first order of business, you are seeking to reform the criminal justice system. Pick one section of Bigotten’s criminal justice system (e.g., police, courts, juvenile justice, corrections) to reform and start your response with a short discussion of the extent and severity of the racial and ethnic bias in the arm of the criminal justice system you aim to reform (use the US as a proxy for Bigotten). Focus the majority of your response on the following: What changes should the state make to the criminal justice system to address racial/ethnic bias? What evidence is there that your plan will work? And, keep in mind that you are up for reelection in a few years so your plan needs to be actionable within four years of taking office. "
"Select one of the following types of crimes: intimate partner violence, serious and violent juvenile offending, drug offending, white-collar crime, or homicide. Choose one criminological theory that you believe best explains the type of crime you selected and discuss why you consider it to be the best explanation. Illustrate in detail how the theory you selected accounts for this crime and cite relevant research that supports your argument.","In recent months, as during the past several years, there is a growing and vocal concern that the criminal justice system actually is a system of injustice. The public claim is that the injustice results from the structural disadvantage and institutional racism that are endemic to American society and the current criminal justice system, affecting the many discretionary decision-points within the system. Please select one component of the criminal justice system (police and law enforcement; courts and sentencing; institutional or community corrections; or the juvenile justice system) for your answer and speak to the level of empirical support for this claim that our criminal justice system is unjust. Your response should: 1) review the strength of empirical support for this claim, with attention to several indicators of structural disadvantage (i.e., inadequate or biased schooling) and institutional racism, 2) identify any other indicators of structural disadvantage and institutional racism that warrant further empirical examination and explain the basis of your choice, and 3) speak to the policy changes that will be required to minimize the effects of structural disadvantage and institutional racism."
"Criminological theorizing is often criticized for being male-centric and unable to account for female experiences, including females’ participation in crime and delinquency. Briefly summarize the main points of this critique using empirical evidence. Also describe and evaluate two theories: one that purports to account for gender similarities in crime and another that purports to account for gender differences in crime. Make a case for which of these theories is a better guide for research going forward.","As a member of the Biden/Harris criminal justice reform committee you are expected to advise the new administration on reform efforts. Choose one of the following domains: crime prevention, law enforcement, the juvenile justice system, courts, or corrections and 1) identify and discuss a current challenge within that domain and 2) recommend a solution to that challenge. The discussion of your recommended solution should demonstrate a clear link between the challenge and solution, the broad impact of the solution, and the empirical evidence supporting this recommendation. We suggest that you spend 1/3 of your response on identifying the challenge and 2/3 of your response on recommending a solution. You can assume that any recommendations made at the federal level would have an impact on state-level reforms."
"The US is highly stratified into the “haves” and “have nots,” with the difference between the two being related to more than just wealth, but also to the marginalization and stigmatization of immigrants, people of color, individuals with disabilities, and women. Yet, criminological theories do not always address this American reality. Discuss one theory that includes stratifiers as a means of explaining or discussing the core tenets of the theory. In your discussion, briefly define the theory, then focus on how the theory uses at least one element of stratification (i.e., race/ethnicity, immigration, sex/gender, disability) as means of explaining or discussing its core tenets. Finally, discuss a theory that does a poor job of including stratifiers in its construction and/or application and what may be a way to change that theory to include stratification/ stratifiers.","Recent events have brought racism back to the center of national debate. Prepare a talk you would give if you were asked to discuss racism in the criminal justice system. In your talk, choose at least one decision point in the criminal justice system (e.g., setting bail, a traffic stop, or sentencing), and address the following points. Through the lens of your chosen decision point, define racism, how it manifests, and why it may exist in the criminal justice system. Next, also discuss the extent of racism surrounding the decision point that is currently present in the criminal justice system; be sure to provide empirical evidence. Third, discuss at least one proposed change that may be useful in addressing racism."
"The pandemic has altered people’s lives dramatically and has had a profound impact on crime. For instance, the preliminary 2020 Uniform Crime Report shows opposing trends for major categories of crime in the first six months of 2020 compared to the first six months of 2019. For example, property crime declined by 7.8%, rape by 17.8% and robbery by 7.1%. At the same time, homicides and nonnegligent manslaughter offenses increased by 14.8% and aggravated assaults increased by 4.6% (see https://tinyurl.com/prelimfbiucr). Use at least two theories to explain the drop in some violent crimes while simultaneously explaining increases in other violent crimes. Finally, discuss whether the theories you used in your answer contradict each other in their explanations of the pandemic-related shifts to violent crime.","Much recent debate has focused on systemic racism in the American criminal justice system. First, discuss how we can best estimate the amount of systemic racism that exists in a legal jurisdiction of your choosing (e.g., an urban police department, a maximum security prison, or a federal district court). Second, present one feasible strategy for reducing systemic racism in the jurisdiction you selected. Finally, identify the weaknesses associated with the strategy and discuss how these weaknesses might be addressed."
"Crime trends are often shaped by historical changes to the economy, demographics, politics or social dynamics of a place, city, or nation. Pick a moment in history (e.g., the current pandemic, the housing crisis of 2007-2009, the drug war of the 1990s, changes in presidents, and the great migration), and use one individual-level theory and one macro-level theory of your choosing to explain any changes in crime over time. Be sure to differentiate as needed between crime types.","To what extent does the ""criminal justice system"" function as an actual system? Draw on theory and research in formulating your response."
"Jeremy Bentham and other pioneers of criminology advanced the notion that criminals are rational actors. First, discuss how Bentham and his contemporaries’ view of rationality changed crime theory and the administration of justice. Second, discuss how two contemporary theories have integrated a revised version of rationality into their explanatory framework. Finally, discuss how and why the concept of rationality might evolve in terms of explaining criminal behavior over the next 50 years.","There is some skepticism about the ability of criminological research to impact criminal justice policy or practice. Write an answer in which you provide one specific example of how (a) research has affected policy/practice OR (b) research has not affected policy/practice. Be sure to cite theory, policy, and research as applicable to support your response."
"In response to a historical or current event (e.g., Great Recession, 9/11, #MeToo, Black Lives Matter), how will/did crime change? Choose one criminological theory and discuss how the theory can be used to explain the possible link between the current/historical event and crime (this can also include victimization, fear of crime, etc.).","“What Works” and “Evidence-Based” are prominent approaches in American policing and corrections, but is that the case in courts? Why or why not? Your answer should address (1) the evidence-based movements in corrections and policing (e.g., their origins, realization in practice, and impact) and (2) suggest whether there is an evidence-based court system in the U.S. "
"Choose one theory and (a) briefly discuss how the theory has changed and developed over time, (b) discuss the current limitations of the theory, and (c) select one of those limitations and explain how you would address that limitation to push the theory forward.","A criminal justice system means that changes to one part of the system will affect other parts of the system. For two changes to the U.S. system, separately, please (1) identify the change, (2) describe its intended impact on one component of the system, (3) as well as its unintended impact on another part of the system."
"Criminal behavior varies by race, class, and gender. Pick two criminological theories and evaluate the extent to which they conceptually and empirically explain or fail to explain these differences. In its totality, which one theory offers the best explanation for these differences?",Please evaluate the use of risk assessment instruments in the criminal justice system by answering the questions below. (1) What are the theoretical and practical foundations of risk assessment? (2) How is risk assessment done in the criminal justice system today? (3) What are the promises and pitfalls of the risk assessment instruments so far? Please incorporate empirical evidence to support your arguments when necessary.
"Theories from the criminological perspectives of strain/anomie, rational choice, social learning and control explain criminal behavior both at the individual level and aggregate levels. For this question, put one theory from two of these perspectives through “theory competition” where you evaluate the merits and limitations of each theory on its logical, conceptual, and empirical components. Based on these merits and limitations, argue which theory you believe is best at explaining criminal behavior at the individual level as well as the aggregate level.","“Mass incarceration” is widely decried by policy makers, elected officials and advocacy groups. That said, it seems to coincide with the great crime decline, and several commentators argue that it played at least some role in the crime decline, particularly violent crime. Construct an argument in which you weigh the pros and cons of mass incarceration and then identify which perspective you believe has the most compelling empirical evidence to support it."
"For most criminological theories, significant technological advances in both research and everyday life have been made after their development. Please select one criminological theory, then discuss how specific technological developments in the past two decades, and the developments of analytical tools, impacted the theory. Does the validity of the theory appear to increase, decrease, or stay about the same? Be sure to incorporate empirical evidence to support your arguments.","Most introductory texts on the criminal justice system indicate that the system has three branches: law enforcement, courts, and corrections. Do you believe there is a fourth branch? If so, please name one and explain why. If not, please pick a group that may appear as the “fourth branch” at the first glance, then explain why it is actually not. Be sure to incorporate and cite relevant empirical research."
"Kurt Lewin observed “there is nothing so practical as a good theory”. That practicality should be evident in the utility of the theory to organize and account for a body of knowledge (facts, research, hypotheses) and describe “practical” ways (interventions, programs, policies) to address crime. Please write an essay to address both prompts below and be sure to use specific examples to support your arguments.

• First, please identify one criminological theory that has demonstrated its practicality and identify the tangible aspects of that theory that have been put into practice. 
• Then, identify one criminological theory that has not demonstrated its practically, and discuss the difficulties with putting this theory into practice.","Scholars often note that there is a disconnect between criminological research and the policies that are created by policymakers. Pick one example that you feel best demonstrates the disconnect between research and policy. Explain (1) what the topic is, (2) what research has revealed about the topic, (3) what the current policies are, and (4) what research suggests about how the current policies should be reformed. Be sure to incorporate and cite relevant empirical research."
How should scholars think about the concept of motivation in criminological theory? ,"In 1967, The President’s Commission Report recommended that police departments should mirror the composition of their communities and in doing so would increase citizen cooperation with the police and improve police-community relations. We have had forty years to experiment with this notion. How would you assess the implementation and success of this recommendation in reducing crime, improving police-community relations and citizen cooperation with the police? "
"Since its publication in 1990, Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990) General Theory of Crime has been subjected to a steady stream of critical attention. Identify three key propositions of Gottfredson and Hirschi’s theory and assess the evidence for or against these propositions. Should future research continue to focus on Gottfredson and Hirschi’s theory or should the field move on? How has the research changed over time? ","Criminologists often lament the lack of experimental control in testing the impact of policies and programs. Instead, the argument goes, they have to depend on statistical controls often made by comparing groups not randomly assigned to control and experimental conditions. Such concerns ignore the often robust controls found in naturally occurring experiments. Supreme Court decisions, changes in the law, and new policy directives often provide methodologically defensible opportunities for assessing the impact of policy changes. Choose three of the four policies/interventions below and identify one naturally occurring experiment of the past two decades for each and how it could lend scientific knowledge about the policy. Be sure to explain the impetus for the experimental conditions. 

		a. Harm reduction in drug use.
		b. The impact of prison over-crowding on recidivism.
		c. The impact of police staffing (office/citizen ratios) on crime.
		d. Police transparency and citizen attitudes toward the police. "
"Select one macro level theory (i.e., social disorganization, institutional anomie, strain), one social psychological theory (i.e., social bonding, social learning, self-control, labeling, reintegrative shaming), and one theory of crime (i.e., rational choice, routine activities, environmental criminology), then discuss each of the theory’s assumptions and policy implications. Describe a program or policy that is based on, or reflects, the principles of each of the selected theories. ","The proposition has been put forth that the criminal justice system is irrelevant to crime control. After all, the key drivers of crime rates are social and economic variables not the criminal justice system. Marriage, employment and concentrated disadvantage account for most of the variation in crime rates, across time, space and population groups. The effects of police strategies, arrest, conviction and incarceration are marginal at best in the panoply of explanations of crime. Indicate whether you agree with the above propositions and discuss why or why not. Be sure your answer addresses (1) a comparison of the explanatory power of criminal justice system and non-criminal justice system variables, and (2) evidence to support your answer from the empirical literature."
"In his published ASC 2010 Sutherland Address, Frank Cullen called for criminologists to move beyond “adolescent-limited criminology.” Adolescent Limited Criminology (ALC) in Cullen’s argument has “privileged self-reports of students” to test theories of crime and concluded that “nothing works.”  He then argues: “a new paradigm is needed that is rooted in life-course criminology, brings criminologists closer to offenders and to the crime event, prioritizes the organization of knowledge, and produces scientific knowledge that is capable of improving offenders’ lives and reducing crime.”

Your task is to sketch out the broad parameters of what that “new paradigm” would look like by specifically identifying: a) what the key variables of that paradigm would be, b) two to three key research questions of the new paradigm, c) how criminologists could get “closer to offenders and the crime event”, and d) what kind of research questions could be asked that could “improve offenders’ lives and reduce crime.” ","The United States is exceptional relative to other countries in that it incarcerates its citizens at a higher rate than any other developed nation. First, compare incarceration in the United States to other countries, and describe the forces that led to the current state of mass incarceration in the U.S. Second, provide a thorough discussion of the effects of mass incarceration. Third, describe strategies to reduce the prison population, as well as how these strategies would affect the crime rate."
"While most criminological theory focuses on macro or micro factors, most crime is committed in groups. In an influential essay in 1985 (Short, James F., Jr. 1985 ""The level of explanation problem in criminology."" Pp. 51-72 in Robert F. Meier (ed.), Theories of Criminology. Beverly Hills: Sage Publications) Jim Short argued that more attention should be paid to mid-range levels of explanation, especially those that emphasize group process. First, discuss why criminology has focused on micro and macro-level explanations of crime. Second, discuss why you do or do not agree with Short that more attention needs to be paid to mid-range explanations of crime. Third, discuss which areas of research would benefit from increased attention to mid-range explanations.","Fyfe (1997) points out that police scholars, practitioners, and the public have often struggled with what encompasses “good policing.” In the first half of your response, discuss how good policing has been defined and assessed, as well as the complexities of such. In the second half of your response, discuss the implications of good policing (and by contrast, bad policing) for subsequent stages of the criminal justice system. Be sure to ground your response both conceptually and empirically when possible."
"Some criminologists have argued that criminological theories should not be integrated because the theories being integrated are based on opposing assumptions, while others have argued that theory integration is essential for the betterment of the field. You have been appointed by the President of the American Society of Criminology to prepare an essay investigating the issue. 

In this essay you have been asked to (1) discuss the main arguments given by criminologists for and against theory integration; and (2) write up your opinion of whether criminologists should integrate theories or not. In doing so, provide evidence based on theoretical works to support your opinion.","The United States is experiencing one of the most cynical periods in history regarding public attitudes toward social institutions. This lack of confidence includes organizations that compose the criminal justice system. Yet, crime rates largely declined during the period in which distrust in social institutions increased. First, discuss the relevance of key developments in the research on procedural justice to explain this seemingly paradoxical relationship. Second, discuss one key development in the criminal justice system (e.g. sentencing reform, mass incarceration, policing strategies, post Sept. 11th legislation) that may also help us better understand this paradox. "
"After some years of decline, violent crime rose significantly in a handful of U.S. cities during 2015-2016. Cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, Washington, and Baltimore had double-digit increases in homicide and assault in those years. Choose two theoretical perspectives and discuss how they may explain this phenomenon. Finally, discuss how you could evaluate the empirical validity of each explanation. What empirical evidence would you collect to test each of your theoretical explanations?","For many years criminological scholars have posited and assessed the role of neighborhoods in crime causation.  Conversely, criminal justice scholars have paid considerably less attention to the role of neighborhoods in the response to crime (setting aside the notion of “hotspots” as a much smaller unit of space compared to neighborhoods).  

a.	Based on the literature trace the development of what is known in terms of how the police come to view and act within the context of neighborhoods.  Be sure to distinguish prior work that is more conceptual in nature (or theory driven) and work that has some degree of empirical testing.  

b.	Identify and discuss the primary gaps within this area of inquiry that still exist and merit future study.

c.	Select one of the gaps identified in B above and briefly discuss how you would go about actually filling the gap.  For example, what type of study would be required?  I want you to think through the parameters of actually conducting a study that would merit a substantial contribution to the literature with respect to how the police come to view and/or respond to crime from a neighborhood or place based context.  At a minimum you should specify the key research question(s), data needs, and methodical/statistical approach."
"In his 2014 Sutherland Address to the American Society of Criminology, David Weisburd argued that the “criminology of place” represents a turning-point that should occur in the life-course of criminology. Further, Weisburd argues that scholars should direct their attention toward studying a physical law (in contrast to studying a causal mechanism), which he dubs the “law of crime concentration.” First, explain how this approach is different from the classical work of Shaw and McKay (i.e. social disorganization theory) and the more contemporary work of Sampson (i.e. collective efficacy theory). Second, from these insights, identify an existing policy, or develop a new policy, that would be consistent with the crime concentration approach or the disorganization/collective efficacy approach, but not both. ","Herbert Packer, in his classic book, The Limits of the Criminal Sanction, discusses two models: (a) the crime control model and (b) the due process model.  Discuss our system of criminal justice and provide illustrations of how these two models operate in contemporary criminal justice policies and practices.  Finally, offer suggestions for reform, including in your discussion the ways in which your suggestions might ""tip the balance"" between these two models and how you might address that issue so as to mitigate any negative impact"
"Perhaps the closest thing criminology has to a law is the fact that males engage in more crime and delinquency than females.  This finding has been observed throughout history, in various countries, in both longitudinal and cross-sectional studies, and using different methods for measuring criminal and delinquent behavior.  First, review evidence that indicates that males engage in more crime than females.  Second, identify two plausible theories that offer explanations for this gender difference and discuss their propositions regarding gender and crime, reviewing the literature to support your points.  Third, based on your review of the theoretical and empirical evidence, draw a conclusion about which theory is better suited for explaining why males and females differ regarding crime and delinquency.","Criminologists have long expressed concern about the number of citizens incarcerated in total institutions (e.g., prisons, jails, juvenile detention). In fact, there has been much discussion of the factors that have lead up to the level of mass Incarceration that exists in the United States today. Mass incarceration is not without its consequences, however. What does the past and current research say regarding the intended consequences and the unintended collateral consequences of mass incarceration? In your response, discuss promising solutions to the consequences of mass incarceration you detail on your answer."
Many fields are currently facing a “replication crisis” as the foundational facts of the discipline are being challenged by the inability to replicate the findings of research. Is Criminology currently facing such a crisis? What are the foundational facts of crime and are these being challenged? Identity one criminological theory that struggles to explain these facts and one criminological theory that succeeds in explaining these facts.,"The criminal justice system is a collection of formal social control institutions predicated on the premise that providing equal treatment for all citizens assures procedural and distributive justice for all citizens. However, industrialized societies are characterized by inequality among citizens on a variety of indicators, such as race, gender, and class. Please discuss the following issues:  What are the consequences for the citizenry and for the criminal justice system when inequality is present? When writing your response, be sure to discuss more than one aspect of the criminal justice system and more than one factor related to inequality, like race, gender, and class."
"In criminology, there are various conceptualizations of “opportunity” as an important element in criminal behaviors. Identify one current criminological theory that does not feature opportunity as a component of that theory and then build a case for either a) why opportunity should not be, or cannot be, a feature of that theory or b) why opportunity can be viewed as consistent with that theory and can be an important addition to that theory. In your response, be sure to define opportunity conceptually.","Discuss two monumental reforms that occurred in the American criminal justice system during the twentieth century--one from the first half (1900 to 1949) and one from the latter half (1950 to 1999). Your discussion should focus on (a) the political, social, and economic forces that initiated and drove through these reforms, and (b) the documented consequences of these reforms. Finally, discuss what lessons for the future (if any) we can take away from these two examples."
"Criminology textbooks tend to get thicker and heavier with each subsequent edition. New theories are added, but none are removed. Pick one theory that you believe is the best candidate for removal. Make a case for the theory’s removal based on empirical evidence, conceptual tenants, logical structure, or other relevant criteria.","Crime prevention and control are central concerns of the criminal justice system in general and public policies and programs in particular. Present and analyze a general or specific strategy, policy, or program that is already in place to treat, prevent, or control criminal or delinquent behavior. Your response should cover: (1) a description of it showing what procedures, steps, or activities are involved, the population to whom it is directed, and its major goals and objectives; (2) a description of the underlying theoretical and philosophical assumptions on which it is based; and (3) a critical review of research evidence that shows the extent to which it has been effective.

Moral beliefs have not received sufficient attention in the criminology literature. Describe two or three theories that have specified the importance of moral beliefs in explaining crime and delinquency. Evaluate each theory in terms of its logical consistency and empirical evidence. Be sure to describe the main effect of moral beliefs and their moderating effects. Should moral beliefs be a key variable in criminological research? And why?,"Gender disparity in the criminal justice system has been noted by researchers.

"Social environments, such as (though not limited to) the family, peer groups, neighborhoods, schools, or work can have profound impacts on individuals’ ability to remain crime free. Pick two criminological theories and apply them to two social environments and discuss how those theories and social environments interact to impact criminal behavior.","Technology is playing an increasingly important role in the functioning of the criminal justice system, from DNA testing and its role in determining wrongful conviction, to crime analysis and body-worn cameras. Yet, often research does not keep pace with the diffusion of that technology. Select two of the major components of the criminal justice system: police, courts (and prosecution), corrections (adult or juvenile). For each component, discuss how technology is affecting the performance of criminal justice actors in that component, based on the available research, and identify major gaps in our knowledge base.

What were the most salient political, social, and economic factors that shaped criminal justice operations in the United States over the past 100 years? Your response should be supported by the best available evidence."
"The vast majority of variance in criminality comes from the individual. Put another way, if trying to explain why someone engages in criminal behavior, individual correlates are your best bet. However, there are other social contexts that influence criminality. Discuss three social contexts that influence criminality and how they may interact with individual correlates of criminal activity.","Since the creation of the modern police with the London Metropolitan Police in 1829, the principal function of patrol has been to reduce crime and maintain feelings of public safety.  How effectively does patrol accomplish these objectives? What do we know about patrol, its routine operation, and its effects? Related, explain how patrol has evolved over time, the theoretical rational for these changes, and the impact of these innovations on crime, disorder, and the public’s perception of the police."
"Qualitative analyses in criminology have a prominent place in the development of criminological theory, yet progression in the modern scientific study of crime has largely been viewed as a distinctly quantitative endeavor. What role might qualitative methods play in the development and refinement of criminological theory moving forward? (i.e., what kinds of contributions can qualitative methods make that quantitative methods cannot?). In your response, you should identify three existing prominent works that are primarily based on qualitative or mixed methods and discuss how they have contributed to the development or refinement of criminological theory.","The philosopher George Santayana famously wrote, ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."" Write an essay where you discuss two monumental reforms that occurred in the American criminal justice system during the twentieth century--one from the first half (1900 to 1949) and one from the latter half (1950 to 1999). Your discussion should focus on (a) the political, social, and economic forces that initiated and drove through these reforms, and (b) the documented consequences of these reforms. Finally, discuss what lessons for the future (if any) we can take away from these two examples."
"Criminologists are interested in the impact of economic factors on crime. In times of economic crisis, what would you predict the pattern of crime to be using criminological theories? Develop an argument with evidence (national and/or international) to support your views, and discuss the usefulness of theories in addressing this question.","In his 2004 Presidential address to the American Society of Criminology, Francis Cullen pondered that ""what we do as criminologists does not matter.""  Write an essay discussing whether the field of criminology is largely irrelevant to policy makers and the functioning of the American criminal justice system. Your essay should focus on the criminal justice system and be supported by examples where the criminal justice system followed criminological research and examples of where it did not, as well as any consequences (intentional or otherwise) associated with both examples."
"Nearly a quarter-century ago, Thomas Bernard (“Twenty Years of Testing Theories: What Have We Learned and Why?” Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency) argued that, despite an abundance of empirical research in criminology, there has been little scientific progress in the sense of theory falsification or fact accumulation.

Assess the validity of this claim with empirical work."
"There are numerous criteria that might be applied when assessing various theoretical perspectives. One such criterion is conceptual clarity. Select two theoretical perspectives in criminology/criminal justice that, in your judgment, fall at opposite ends of the spectrum with regard to this criterion. More specifically, select one theoretical perspective that you feel is characterized by relatively clear concepts, and one that is characterized by relatively vague concepts. Be sure to describe/discuss each of these perspectives in detail and to identify the key concepts associated with each. Further, make certain to explain the basis of your judgment concerning the clarity or vagueness of these concepts. Finally, present a discussion of the ways in which conceptual clarity has advanced the development and empirical testing of one of these theoretical perspectives, and conceptual ambiguity has hindered the development and empirical testing of the other perspective.
